        <p>
          Hi! My name is Tingyo Chang and I am a sophomore at USC studying
          Narrative Studies and Law, History, & Culture, as well as Web
          Development. I am deeply passionate about storytelling, which is why I
          am pursuing a degree in Narrative Studies, which allows me to both
          practice creative writing and put a critical lens on the narratives we
          see in popular media. I also intend to pursue a career in law; our
          legal system is composed of intersecting narratives on peoples,
          cultures, and histories. Understanding the underlying narratives that
          our legal system rests on can allow for a more empathetic and
          effective legal system that benefits all people. On this website you
          can access my writing samples, both creative and analytical.
